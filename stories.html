  <p style="font-size: 23px;padding: 20px;">I recently had the opportunity to visit the Swat Valley in Pakistan, and I was absolutely blown away. It is a truly stunning place, with towering mountains, lush green valleys, and crystal-clear rivers.

I spent my days exploring the valley, hiking to hidden waterfalls, visiting ancient villages, and picnicking in meadows full of wildflowers. I also had the chance to try some of the local cuisine, which was delicious.</p>

            <h2>White Palace:</h2>
            <p style=font-size:20px;>The White Palace of Marghazar was built in 1940 by the first king of Swat, Miangul Abdul Wadud (Badshah Sahib) in the small town of Marghazar situated at about 13 kilometers away from Saidu Sharif. The name was given to the palace as it was built of white marble. The palace now serves as a hotel and is a very famous tourist resort.</p>
       <p style=font-size:20px;> I recently had the opportunity to visit the White Palace, and I was absolutely mesmerized by its beauty. I spent hours wandering the palace grounds, admiring the intricate carvings and architecture. I also took the time to enjoy the stunning views of the valley from the palace windows.
One of my favorite things about the White Palace is the way it blends in with its natural surroundings. The white marble of the palace walls perfectly complements the green of the forests and the white of the snow-capped peaks. It is as if the palace was built to be a part of this landscape.
If you are ever in the Swat Valley, I highly recommend visiting the White Palace. It is a truly unforgettable experience.</p>
